##  Description
This project is a fully deployed basic blog posting site, and it utilizes an MVC framework that allows users with saved accounts to create, edit and delete both blog posts and comments to existing posts. This site uses the mysql dialect with sequelize to store and manipulate information on users, posts and comments. It also uses handle bars to generate display pages and makes use of express sessions to register when a user has successfully logged in or created an account. For a more direct look at the app feel free to visit the deployed site through the link below.
